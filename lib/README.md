# game-engine-lib
This is the official library for my game center project.

In order for the functions to run correctly, you must have these environment variables set:
- `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` - URL for MongoDB Atlas database
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY` - string for your access token key
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY` - string for your refresh token key
- `ADMIN_CODES` - comma separated admin codes (e.g. `"h3ll0,w0rld"`)
